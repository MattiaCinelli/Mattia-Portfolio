- # Kaggle Challenge: Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)
In this [Kaggle competion](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia?) a set of 5,863 chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients, between the age of one to five years old, in Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of the patient's routine clinical care. 

All chest radiographs were screened  by two expert physicians for quality control and removing all low quality or unreadable scans.

In the picture below are show the three type of chest X-ray present in the database:

![Banner](https://github.com/MattiaCinelli/mycolorpalette/blob/master/commons/banner.png?raw=true)


This Python package handles user created color palettes scheme to be used in Python plotting libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, etch).

Users can use specific colors in accordance with their taste or company guidelines that are different from the defaults in matplotlib. Therefore, mypalette helps to create, store, and use color palettes.

It can use a text file from https://coolors.co or a list of hexadecimal codes and saves a JSON format, comprising of colors: name, hexadecimal and RGB codes.

If you have been more than five seconds on r/dataisbeautiful/, you will have probably encountered a Sankey plot. Everyone uses to track their expenses, job searching and every multi step processes. Indeed, it is very suitable to visualize the progression of events and their outcome.
And in my opinion, they look great!

Therefore, letâ€™s see how to do in Python
