## Education
### Ph.D.
Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)

University College London (UCL), United Kingdom, 2013 – 2017
Field Of Study: Computational Immunology
*Thesis title*: [Analysis of murine CDR3β repertoires using machine learning techniques.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332697445_Analysis_of_murine_CDR3b_repertoires_using_machine_learning_techniques) (2018)

Role: I analysed the role and mechanisms of the CDR3 sequence, a short protein region present on the T cell receptor, using state of the art of machine learning methods. The intent of my research was to apply and develop methods for the classification of CDR3 repertoires and, though the classification process, identify the amino acids and positions that play a major role in the mechanism of antigen recognition.

Founded by Microsoft 2013 PhD Scholarship Programme in EMEA Microsoft scholarships consist of an annual bursary up to a maximum of three years for PhD supervisors and students to do collaborative research projects with Microsoft Research Cambridge.

#### Publications:
- [Tracking global changes induced in the CD4 T-cell receptor repertoire by immunization with a complex antigen using short stretches of CDR3 protein sequence.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25095879/) (2014)
- [Feature selection using a one dimensional naïve Bayes’ classifier increases the accuracy of support vector machine classification of CDR3 repertoires.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28073756/) (2017)
- [Specificity, Privacy, and Degeneracy in the CD4 T Cell Receptor Repertoire Following Immunization.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28450864/) (2017)

### Master Degree

- ## [Kaggle Challenge: Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://github.com/MattiaCinelli/notebooks/blob/master/chest_xray_pneumonia.ipynb)
In this [Kaggle competion](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia?) a set of 5,863 chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients, between the age of one to five years old, in Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of the patient's routine clinical care. 

All chest radiographs were screened  by two expert physicians for quality control and removing all low quality or unreadable scans.

In the picture below are show the three type of chest X-ray present in the database:

- ## [My Palette](https://github.com/MattiaCinelli/mycolorpalette)
A fully pubblished Python Packege
![Banner](https://github.com/MattiaCinelli/mycolorpalette/blob/master/commons/banner.png?raw=true)

This [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/mypalette/) handles user created color palettes scheme to be used in Python plotting libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, etch).

Users can use specific colors in accordance with their taste or company guidelines that are different from the defaults in matplotlib. Therefore, mypalette helps to create, store, and use color palettes.

It can use a text file from https://coolors.co or a list of hexadecimal codes and saves a JSON format, comprising of colors: name, hexadecimal and RGB codes.

- ## [Sankey Plot in Python](https://github.com/MattiaCinelli/notebooks/blob/master/sankey_plots.ipynb)
Example of Data Visualization

</p>
If you have been more than five seconds on r/dataisbeautiful/, you will have probably encountered a Sankey plot. Everyone uses to track their expenses, job searching and every multi step processes. Indeed, it is very suitable to visualize the progression of events and their outcome.
And in my opinion, they look great!
