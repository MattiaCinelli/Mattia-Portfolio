This package handles user created color palettes scheme to be used in Python plotting libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, etch).

Users can use specific colors in accordance with their taste or company guidelines that are different from the defaults in matplotlib. Therefore, mypalette helps to create, store, and use color palettes.

It can use a text file from https://coolors.co or a list of hexadecimal codes and saves a JSON format, comprising of colors: name, hexadecimal and RGB codes.
